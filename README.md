# Back-a-Slash

This project is a browser extension that acts like the "up arrow" of a file explorer.  It redirects the user's webpage to its parent directory in one click.

For example, from by clicking the extension button from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew#/media/File:Andrew_23_aug_1992_1231Z.jpg, the user will be redirected to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew#/media

This utility may be useful and could save a couple keystrokes when navigating websites with numerous subdirectories/paths.
