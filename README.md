# Back-a-Slash

This project is a browser extension that acts like the "up arrow" of a file explorer.  It redirects the user's webpage to its parent directory in one click.

For example, by clicking the extension button from https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/commands, the user will be redirected to https://developer.chrome.com/extensions

This utility may be useful when exploring websites and could save a couple keystrokes when navigating websites with numerous subdirectories/paths.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The user can use **Ctrl-Up** (**Command-Up** on a Mac) to use the extension as defined.
To open the parent directory in a new tab, the user can use **Ctrl-Shift-Up** (**Command-Shift-Up** on a Mac).
